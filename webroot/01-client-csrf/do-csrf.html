<!--
This file performs requests to update the site from an external source
This file is just hosted by our regular webserver, so the origin is
the same.  However, without further mitigations we could run any of
this code from an external site (like the course website, as we did in
class) and it would work--this is the CSRF attack!

Note: As of 2024, this attack is difficult to perform with modern
browsers and tools.  Specifically:
- Chrome does not allow setting cookies with SameSite=None that are
  not served via HTTPS.  To run this demo locally, you should use
  Firefox instead (as of 2024) does not have this requirement by default.

- Recent version of Firefox and other browsers commonly isolate
  cookies for each site so cross-origin requests cannot access them.  To
  run the attack, you should disable any browser settings for cookie
  site isolation, as well as any privacy settings or extensions that
  block third-party cookies.
